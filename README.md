### Motivation
The business issue our project addresses is ensuring that our course recommendation system
effectively engages users by recommending courses that match their interests. According to Coursera,
72% of the respondents to their survey took online courses to advance their careers (Marinova, 2015).

Hence, it is evident that users are keen on developing their skills to further their careers. Therefore, this project
aim to implement a system that recommends courses that provide skills relevant to their area of
interest to foster professional development and maximise learning.
The corresponding machine learning problem to this business issue is building a hybrid
recommendation system incorporating clustering, predictive modelling, NLP, and weighting multiple
models to engage users effectively and aid their professional development through personalised
course recommendations. It involves handling complex challenges such as sparse user-item
interaction data, diverse user preferences, and the cold-start problem. Our solution incorporates ML
techniques, innovative feature engineering, and optimization strategies to enhance recommendation
accuracy and efficiency.
